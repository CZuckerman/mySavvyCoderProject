  <h2> Describing Myself: </h2>

<img src = "myattributes.png" width= 80% alt-text = "image shows word cloud of text including: I'm self-starting, dedicated, resourceful">

<p>I don't like photos, but I do love learning, and I'm going back to my "tech" roots. I've spent a number of years in the business world, doing various techie and non-techie things, then went back to school for my Master of Science in Education, and became a certified teacher. I've spent 18 years teaching, and I've had enough of "torturing" myself with getting up every day and being at school before dawn! So... now, I'm taking a great boot-camp through SavvyCoders, and it's going to be a good ride!</p>
<br>

<h2>A few quick facts about me</h2>
<ul>
  <li>I'm fluent in English, American Sign Language and somewhat in Spanish (mostlyreceptive)</li>
  <li>I'm Deaf, so if I don't answer you, the most likely answer is that I didn't hear you</li>
  <li>I love learning, and sometimes I fall down a rabbit-hole so I use a timer to keep on track</li>
</ul>

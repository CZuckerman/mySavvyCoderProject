## Describing Myself:

![I'm self-starting, dedicated, resourceful](myattributes.png)

I love learning, and I'm going back to my "tech" roots. I've spent a number of years in the business world, doing various techie and non-techie things, went back to school for my M.S. in Education, and became a certified teacher. I spent 18 years teaching, and I've just completed a great boot-camp through the Tech Workforce Program, and it's been a great experience!

## A few quick facts about me

+ I'm fluent in English, Spanish (mostly), and American Sign Language
+ I'm Deaf, so if I don't answer you, the most likely answer is that I didn't hear you
+ I love learning, and sometimes I fall down a rabbit-hole so I use a timer to keep on track

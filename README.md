## Describing Myself:

![I'm self-starting, dedicated, resourceful](myattributes.png)

I don't like photos, but I do love learning, and I'm going back to my "tech" roots. I've spent a number of years in the business world, doing various techie and non-techie things, then went back to school for my Master of Science in Education, and became a certified teacher. I've spent 18 years teaching, and I've had enough of "torturing" myself with getting up every day and being at school before dawn! So... now, I'm taking a great boot-camp through SavvyCoders, and it's going to be a good ride!

## A few quick facts about me

+ I'm fluent in English, Spanish (mostly), and American Sign Language
+ I'm Deaf, so if I don't answer you, the most likely answer is that I didn't hear you
+ I love learning, and sometimes I fall down a rabbit-hole so I use a timer to keep on track

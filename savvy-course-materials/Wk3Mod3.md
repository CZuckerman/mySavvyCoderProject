## Events
### Building interactive Applications

An _event handler_ is a function (subroutine) that is run when some pre-defined "event" occurs in the browser. Try to make the following work in the dev console while inspecting your Portfolio Project:

```javascript
function sayHey() {
  console.log('heeey')
}
// Alternately, we can ask the browser to run it at a later time

// The below is called an event handler, take a guess at what it does...
// Add it to an HTML document containing a div#target and test it out
document.querySelector('#target').addEventListener('click', sayHey);

// Often times, instead of using a variable, we'll just define the function inline
document.querySelector('#target').addEventListener('click', function saySameDeal() {
  console.log('same deal')
});
```

Ok, that's the native JavaScript syntax for adding event handlers to the page. Now let's see jQuery's way! Try this in your console as well:

```javascript
$('div').on('click', function logOnClick(){
  console.log('A div has been clicked!')
})

// shortcut
$('p').click(function makeBoom(){
  $('p').show().css('color', 'red').text('boom goes the dynamite!')
});
```

### A new syntax (part 2)

When a function is used as a callback, it's often written inline as in the example above. These function traditionally don't have names of their own, and are instead referred to as __anonymous functions__.

As you see in the examples above, they can be fairly tedious to write out. To help with this (and with the binding of the `this` keyword, which we'll cover later), JavaScript as given us a new syntax for anonymous functions called "arrow" syntax. It looks like this:

```javascript
// original syntax
$( "div" ).on( "click", function logOnClick(){
  console.log( "A div has been clicked!" );
})

// arrow function
$( "div" ).on( "click", () => console.log( "A div has been clicked" ) );
```



## Portfolio Project 1
### Adding Effects

There are _lots_ of events to learn about. Let's try a few by adding them to the JavaScript files for the landing page of our Portfolio Projects.

1. Add some CSS rules for a class called `highlighted`. Maybe make the text bolder, or change color, or change the opacity of the background... it's up to you!
2. Add the following to your JavaScript file:

```javascript
$('li').on('mouseover', () => {
  $('li').addClass('highlighted')
})
$('li').on('mouseleave', () => {
  $('li').removeClass('highlighted')
})
```

How does this work?
3. Let's add a click handler for your face. When users click on your photo on your profile page, a previously-hidden blurb should be revealed with a jQuery animation. There are lots of options here, but something like this should work:

```javascript
$('#profile-pic').on('click', () => {
  $('#hidden-blurb').slideDown(); // only works if #hidden-blurb has display:none; in its CSS
});
```
4. Add at least one more jQuery animation effect on click!

## `this` and `event`

We've already seen once before how we can pass in an `event` Object to an event handler. That argument has a few properties associated with it, like `.preventDefault()` (take a look at the Hack-A-Thon code to see what we mean.) One of those properties is the __calling context__ of the event... the thing that is triggering the event. Try modifying your code from your Portfolio Project to something like this:

```javascript
$('li').on('mouseover', (event) => {
  var target = event.target;
  $(target).addClass('highlighted');
})
$('li').on('mouseleave', (event) => {
  var target = event.target;
  $(target).removeClass('highlighted');
})
```
Now only the hovered-over element is highlighted (which is very much the behavior that we're really looking for in a highlighter). This operation is so common with events (and with functions in general), that JavaScript generalizes the calling context for any function into a `this` keyword. In the case of jQuery events, the calling context of the function is equal to the DOM node from which the event originated (a.k.a. the `event.target` from the previous example). Try the following refactor (it should work the same as `event.target` in this case):

```javascript
$('li').on('mouseover', function highlight(){ // notice: no arrow function!
  $(this).addClass('highlighted')
})
$('li').on('mouseleave', function highlight(){
  $(this).removeClass('highlighted')
})
```

## Portfolio Project 2
### Adding `this` effects

With the time remaining in class, try out a few of jQuery's built-in event shortcuts, including `.click()`, `.hover()`, `.submit()`, and `.keypress()`. Add an effect or animation on each event using `this` to capture the calling context of the target element. When you're happy with your fancy new event-driven site, push your changes to your GitHub profile and live to Netlify!

## Bonus
### Improving your adventure

Previously, our Choose-Your-Own-Adventure game used `prompt()` and `alert()` to interact with the users. Now, we can use events to customize our own prompts and responses! Try using `input` elements with the `submit` event to drive your new Choose Your Own Adventure game.

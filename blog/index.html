<h3>January 23, 2018</h3>
<p>As I embark on this journey through TWP Bootcamp, I will add some thoughts to this blog. I'm finding it to be an interesting experience, requiring me to stretch my thinking and finally start my personal portfolio.</p>

<h3>January 27, 2018</h3>
<p>Once I get myself into the zone, I find I can make serious progress with coding. I've created several pages, added external CSS, and will continue to improve on my UX/UI and content.
<br>

<h3>February 3, 2018</h3>
<p>I've now worked on a collaborative page with the rest of the class, it's our "Class Showcase" where we have links to all the students' sites. Not hard to do, just remember to push your work, and then do a "pull request" for the site integration manager.
<br>

<h3>February 10, 2018</h3>
<p>I've finally gotten my nav bar and navigation links working the way I wanted, and updated the "h1" tags on each page to be more clear in case a screen reader is used. I also fixed the dropdown on the Projects nav link. Happy camper here!
<br>

<h3>February 17, 2018</h3>
<p>It's definitely getting more complicated as we delve deeper into what JavaScript can do, along with jQuery. At first I though it was more confusing to remember the jQuery "shorthand notation", but really, it's not. A bit of practice and repetition and it feels pretty normal now.</p>
<p>I'm getting more ideas on doing a more in-depth browser-based Create-Your-Own-Adventure, and looking at using more CSS and animations in CSS and jQuery to make it more visually appealing, while still being fully accessible.</p>
<br>

<h3>February 24, 2018</h3>
<p>JavaScript is an interesting language, with lots of intricacies, and there are more "frameworks" than I can count! JQuery, ES6, ES5, Angular JS, and more. I found a site listing 20 different frameworks, and I'm sure that's not a complete list! I'm finding it a bit challenging to know when it's best to use vanilla JS, jQuery, etc. As I get further into JS, I'm sure it will get more clear. </p>
<br>

<h3>March 6, 2018</h3>
<p>We're down to the wire, last week of class, and I've learned that virtually anything and everything can and probably should be refactored. Even major app and web companies are continously updating, upgrading their apps/sites, I'm constantly updating my library of iPhone apps with updates that state: "bug fixes and improvements". </p>
<br>

<h3>March 10, 2018</h3>
<p>Graduation Day!! We've made it to the end... and Demo Day is yet to come. I can see by looking at my classmates' Github projects that we have a wide variety of skills and interests! I like the design and planning aspect of coding, but I'm loving the "break it down" and exploring the best way to get something done.</p>
